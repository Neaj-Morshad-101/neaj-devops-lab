# A collector is a named set of related metrics that are collected together. It can be referenced by name, possibly
# along with other collectors.

    # A metric is a Prometheus metric with name, type, help text and (optional) additional labels, paired with exactly
    # one query to populate the metric labels and values from.
    #
    # The result columns conceptually fall into two categories:
    #  * zero or more key columns: their values will be directly mapped to labels of the same name;
    #  * one or more value columns:
    #     * if exactly one value column, the column name is ignored and its value becomes the metric value
    #     * with multiple value columns, a `value_label` must be defined; the column name will populate this label and
    #       the column value will populate the metric value.
