mssql_up: UP Status
mssql_product_version: Instance version (Major.Minor)
mssql_instance_local_time: Number of seconds since epoch on local instance
mssql_connections: Number of active connections (with labels: database, state)
mssql_client_connections: Number of active client connections (with labels: client, database)
mssql_deadlocks: Number of lock requests per second that resulted in a deadlock since last restart
mssql_user_errors: Number of user errors/sec since last restart
mssql_kill_connection_errors: Number of kill connection errors/sec since last restart
mssql_database_state: Databases states: 0=ONLINE 1=RESTORING 2=RECOVERING 3=RECOVERY_PENDING 4=SUSPECT 5=EMERGENCY 6=OFFLINE 7=COPYING 10=OFFLINE_SECONDARY (with label: database)
mssql_log_growths: Total number of times the transaction log for the database has been expanded last restart (with label: database)
mssql_database_filesize: Physical sizes of files used by database in KB, their names, and types (0=rows, 1=log, 2=filestream, 3=n/a 4=fulltext(before v2008 of MSSQL)) (with labels: database, logicalname, type, filename)
mssql_page_read_total: Page reads/sec
mssql_page_write_total: Page writes/sec
mssql_page_life_expectancy: Indicates the minimum number of seconds a page will stay in the buffer pool on this node without references. The traditional advice from Microsoft used to be that the PLE should remain above 300 seconds
mssql_lazy_write_total: Lazy writes/sec
mssql_page_checkpoint_total: Checkpoint pages/sec
mssql_io_stall: Wait time (ms) of stall since last restart (with labels: database, type)
mssql_io_stall_total: Wait time (ms) of stall since last restart (with label: database)
mssql_batch_requests: Number of Transact-SQL command batches received per second. This statistic is affected by all constraints (such as I/O, number of users, cachesize, complexity of requests, and so on). High batch requests mean good throughput
mssql_transactions: Number of transactions started for the database per second. Transactions/sec does not count XTP-only transactions (transactions started by a natively compiled stored procedure.) (with label: database)
mssql_page_fault_count: Number of page faults since last restart
mssql_memory_utilization_percentage: Percentage of memory utilization
mssql_total_physical_memory_kb: Total physical memory in KB
mssql_available_physical_memory_kb: Available physical memory in KB
mssql_total_page_file_kb: Total page file in KB
mssql_available_page_file_kb: Available page file in KB
These metrics provide insights into various aspects of MSSQL server performance and health, allowing administrators to monitor and optimize database operations effectively.
