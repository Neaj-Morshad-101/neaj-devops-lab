I looked into Meilisearch a bit, and it seems the open-source version doesn’t support native clustering. If we support it, would a standalone setup support be enough?

Are we self-hosting Meilisearch or using a managed cloud service?

The Meilisearch Cloud offering advertises “native support for clusterization” and read-side high availability


They have some experimental stuff to configure clustering like setup, but It may have limitations:

Experimental replication parameters:

Implement sharding with remote federated search: 
https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/multi_search/implement_sharding


As far as I read: 
We can shard the data across multiple standalone Meilisearch instances and federate queries to fan‐out a search request to each shard/instance and merge the results client‑side.

We may lack the built‑in consensus, leader election, or automated data sync.



So, user are reponsible for both replication and sharding at the application layer:

Replication: 
For writes we need to POST every document insert/update to all Meili instances so every replica stays in sync.

Sharding:
We split it into shards and route writes only to the instance(s) responsible for each shard.
On search, we have to send the query to each relevant shard‑instance and merges the results.
