# THERE IS NOT WAY LIKE THIS!

To run a multi-container, distributed application like a Milvus cluster on a single machine, the standard and officially recommended tool is **Docker Compose**.

**Docker Compose** is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. You use a single YAML file (`docker-compose.yml`) to configure all the application's services, networks, and volumes. Then, with a single command, you can create and start all the services from your configuration.

### **Full Guide: Milvus Cluster with Docker Compose**

The Milvus project provides an official, pre-made Docker Compose configuration that sets up the entire cluster for you. We will use that.

#### **Step 1: Prerequisites**

1.  **Docker:** You already have this.
2.  **Docker Compose:** It is usually included with Docker Desktop. If you are on Linux without Docker Desktop, you may need to [install it separately](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
3.  **System Resources:** A Milvus cluster is resource-intensive. Ensure your Docker environment has access to at least **4 CPU cores and 8 GB of RAM**.

#### **Step 2: Get the Official Docker Compose Files**

The easiest way is to download the configuration file directly from the Milvus GitHub repository.

1.  Create a new directory for your cluster setup and navigate into it. This keeps things organized.
    ```bash
    mkdir milvus-cluster-docker
    cd milvus-cluster-docker
    ```

2.  Download the `docker-compose.yml` file:
    ```bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/milvus-io/milvus/master/deployments/docker/cluster/docker-compose.yml
    ```
    *(If you don't have `wget`, you can use `curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/milvus-io/milvus/master/deployments/docker/cluster/docker-compose.yml`)*

This single file contains the definitions for all the Milvus components and their dependencies (Etcd, MinIO, and Pulsar).

#### **Step 3: Understand the `docker-compose.yml` File (Optional but Recommended)**

If you open the `docker-compose.yml` file, you will see a list of `services`. It's a direct parallel to the pods you saw in Kubernetes:
*   `etcd`: The metadata store.
*   `minio`: The object storage for data and index files.
*   `pulsar`: The log broker for messaging between components.
*   `proxy`: The main entry point for your client.
*   `rootcoord`, `querycoord`, `datacoord`, `indexcoord`: The master/coordinator nodes.
*   `querynode`, `datanode`, `indexnode`: The worker nodes that do the heavy lifting.

It also defines shared networks and volumes so all these containers can communicate and persist data.

#### **Step 4: Start the Milvus Cluster**

This is the beautifully simple part. From inside your `milvus-cluster-docker` directory, run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

*   `up`: This command builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service.
*   `-d`: **D**etached mode. This runs the containers in the background and leaves your terminal free.

Docker Compose will now pull all the necessary images for etcd, minio, pulsar, and all the Milvus components and start them up in the correct order. This will take a few minutes, especially the first time.

#### **Step 5: Verify the Cluster is Running**

To check the status of all your containers, run:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

You should see a long list of containers. Initially, some might show `starting`. Wait a few minutes, and they should all eventually show a `STATUS` of `Up (healthy)`.

```
               Name                              Command               State                     Ports
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
milvus-cluster-docker_datacoord_1       /tini -- /milvus/bin/milvu ...   Up (healthy)
milvus-cluster-docker_datanode_1        /tini -- /milvus/bin/milvu ...   Up (healthy)
milvus-cluster-docker_etcd_1            etcd -advertise-client-url ...   Up (healthy)   2379/tcp, 2380/tcp
milvus-cluster-docker_indexcoord_1      /tini -- /milvus/bin/milvu ...   Up (healthy)
milvus-cluster-docker_indexnode_1       /tini -- /milvus/bin/milvu ...   Up (healthy)
milvus-cluster-docker_minio_1           /usr/bin/docker-entrypoint ...   Up (healthy)   9000/tcp
milvus-cluster-docker_proxy_1           /tini -- /milvus/bin/milvu ...   Up (healthy)   0.0.0.0:19530->19530/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9091->9091/tcp
milvus-cluster-docker_pulsar_1          bin/pulsar standalone            Up (healthy)
milvus-cluster-docker_querycoord_1      /tini -- /milvus/bin/milvu ...   Up (healthy)
milvus-cluster-docker_querynode_1       /tini -- /milvus/bin/milvu ...   Up (healthy)
milvus-cluster-docker_rootcoord_1       /tini -- /milvus/bin/milvu ...   Up (healthy)
```
The key is the `proxy` service, which maps port `19530` on your host to the container's port.

#### **Step 6: Connect and Test**

Because the `proxy` service port is published to `localhost`, you can use the **exact same Python client script** you used for your Kubernetes deployments. The connection details are identical.

Your script connecting to `host="localhost", port="19530"` will now connect to the `proxy` container of your Docker Compose cluster.

### **Step 7: Managing Your Docker Compose Cluster**

Here are the essential commands for managing the cluster lifecycle:

*   **To stop the cluster (without deleting data):**
    ```bash
    docker-compose stop
    ```
*   **To start it again:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose start
    ```
*   **To view logs of a specific service (e.g., the proxy):**
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f proxy
    ```
*   **To stop AND completely remove all containers, networks, and volumes (for a clean slate):**
    ```bash
    docker-compose down -v
    ```
    *(The `-v` is important as it also removes the data volumes.)*

### Standalone Docker vs. Cluster Docker Compose

| Feature              | Standalone (`standalone_embed.sh`)                                | Cluster (`docker-compose.yml`)                                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Number of Containers** | 1                                                                 | ~11                                                            |
| **Components**       | All Milvus components bundled into one process.                   | Each Milvus component runs as a separate container.            |
| **Dependencies**     | Etcd is embedded. MinIO is local storage inside the container.    | Full, separate containers for Etcd, MinIO, and Pulsar.         |
| **Use Case**         | **Development, testing, and small projects.** Very easy to start/stop. | **Production simulation, performance testing, larger projects.** |
| **Resource Usage**   | Lower (e.g., 2 CPU, 4 GB RAM)                                     | Higher (e.g., 4+ CPU, 8+ GB RAM)                               |
| **Scalability**      | None. It's a single unit.                                         | Can be scaled by changing `replicas` in the YAML file.         |
